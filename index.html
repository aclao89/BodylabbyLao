            <p>"I was lucky enough to have Alex as my trainer for a year and half. Overall, I wanted to get into a consistent workout routine and feel stronger, and he was able to put together a regiment to hit my goals.
                Whether it was weight training one day or cardio-focused the next day, Alex made sure the workouts I did were bringing me closer to getting stronger/reaching my goals. I also appreciated how he always checked in with me at the end of our session, asking me to rate 1-10 how hard it was so he could plan accordingly for our next workout.
                Alex taught me a lot about exercise and how to "use" the gym. Previously, I never went to the gym because I was 1) intimidated, and 2) I didn't know how to use anything other than the treadmill. His guidance led me to feel more confident about working out on my own, and there are many tips/workouts of his that I retain till today.
                On top of being a great trainer who was challenging, but always encouraging, Alex is simply a great person. I'm grateful for the friendship we were able to build over the years, and I highly recommend him to anyone who is looking to invest in their health. Alex is equipped to get you where you want to be, all the while rooting you on from the sideline like the pal he is."</p>

            <p>"If you are seeing this, it’s your lucky day! Contact Alex NOW!
                Before I met Alex, I was overweight, tired and unhappy. I’ve struggled with my weight my whole life.
                I was sure I am doing enough. Alex proved me wrong. We worked on building strength and muscle mass and kept adjusting to my capabilities.
                A year later, I lost 60lbs and am confident and happy. Alex focused on giving me the knowledge and tools to carry on my own and ensured the change is sustainable."</p>

            <p>"Our training sessions have been a great sense of normalcy and something I look forward to each week. Although virtual training was new for both of us, Alex always came super prepared to sessions and gave me exercises that challenged me week after week.  (Even when I complained -- planks UGH!).
            I highly recommend virtual training while we are all away from the gym - especially training with Alex. He will push you to be stronger and meet you where you are in your journey."</p>

            <p>"Doing anything during quarantine is difficult, especially staying active and motivated.
                3 months of personal training with Alex definitely made the challenges of working out during COVID easier.
                Even with the virtual training, Alex was able to make it feel as if he’s right there next to you, attentive to your body movements, correcting your form and always checking to see what my limits were.  In the past 3 months, I have been challenged and pushed by Alex and this has inspired me to set new goals.
                His program made sure each week provided a challenge and my body was getting gradually stronger, always checking in to see where I was at physically and mentally.
                He’s got a great ability to connect with his clients and made our sessions something I looked forward to each week.  Thanks Alex!”</p>

            <p>Personally, finding the time and motivation to work out while juggling a full-time job is hard. If I had to use a word to define Alex, it is accountable – he provides the element of accountability that encourages you, session-after-session. He is not only a great trainer, but he also has the intangible characteristic (think about a star athlete) that makes you want give the workout your all. The opportunity to train with Alex is second to none and I highly recommend anyone to him for personal training.</p>


            <h4 class ="section__title section__title--services">Ling K.</h4>
            <p>"Alex has been my personal trainer in the past 2.5 years. He is indeed the best PT I have worked with so far. Alex is positive and encouraging. He coached me on building skills and also healthier habits in the long run.
                I appreciate Alex’s coaching and highly recommend Alex to anyone who would like to start or advance on physical exercise."</p>



            <h4 class ="section__title section__title--services">Chaitra V.</h4>

            <p>"Alex is an amazing trainer and I have had the privilege of working with for a year now. He has such unique understanding of how the body joints and muscle tissues work that he is able to customize any routine based on how my body is feeling that day.
                 I have weak shoulders and he designs the exercises so that I get the best workout possible without causing any further tension/injury in those spots.
                 He gives lot of attention to form accuracy." </p>
