            <h4>Chaitra V.</h4>

            <p>Alex is an amazing trainer and I have had the privilege of working with for a year now. He has such unique understanding of how the body joints and muscle tissues work that he is able to customize any routine based on how my body is feeling that day.
             I have weak shoulders and he designs the exercises so that I get the best workout possible without causing any further tension/injury in those spots.
             He gives lot of attention to form accuracy </p>

            <p>If you are seeing this, it’s your lucky day! Contact Alex NOW!
                Before I met Alex, I was overweight, tired and unhappy. I’ve struggled with my weight my whole life.
                I was sure I am doing enough. Alex proved me wrong. We worked on building strength and muscle mass and kept adjusting to my capabilities.
                A year later, I lost 60lbs and am confident and happy. Alex focused on giving me the knowledge and tools to carry on my own and ensured the change is sustainable.</p>

            <h4>Jenna S.</h4>

            <p>Our training sessions have been a great sense of normalcy and something I look forward to each week. Although virtual training was new for both of us, Alex always came super prepared to sessions and gave me exercises that challenged me week after week.  (Even when I complained -- planks UGH!).
            I highly recommend virtual training while we are all away from the gym - especially training with Alex. He will push you to be stronger and meet you where you are in your journey.</p>


            <h4>Ling K.</h4>
            <p>Alex has been my personal trainer in the past 2.5 years. He is indeed the best PT I have worked with so far. Alex is positive and encouraging. He coached me on building skills and also healthier habits in the long run.
                I appreciate Alex’s coaching and highly recommend Alex to anyone who would like to start or advance on physical exercise.</p>


            <h4>Jessica L.</h4>
            <p>Doing anything during quarantine is difficult, especially staying active and motivated.
                3 months of personal training with Alex definitely made the challenges of working out during COVID easier.
                Even with the virtual training, Alex was able to make it feel as if he’s right there next to you, attentive to your body movements, correcting your form and always checking to see what my limits were.  In the past 3 months, I have been challenged and pushed by Alex and this has inspired me to set new goals.
                His program made sure each week provided a challenge and my body was getting gradually stronger, always checking in to see where I was at physically and mentally.
                He’s got a great ability to connect with his clients and made our sessions something I looked forward to each week.  Thanks Alex!”</p>
